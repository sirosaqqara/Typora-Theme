## Introduction
When I used the [sspai](https://github.com/wilde3/typora-theme-redrail) theme for the first time, I was amazed by the refreshing effect it presented . <br>
As a dark mode lover, I am not enjoy the Typora's interface with a white background, but I don't know Typora's theme that well . So I did a lot of references online and learned a little bit about making a theme of Typora, and finally finished this Ti theme.

## About exporting
Due to the limitation of Typora, you cannot export md files to pdf files under the dark mode theme, you can choose the following methods:
1. Change the theme to another light theme, then you can export the pdf file normally
2. If you still want to export a pdf file in this theme style, you can export as html first, then open the exported html file in your browser and save the page as pdf
